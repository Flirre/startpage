* Startup page
** Background
Inspired by the different creations found at [[https://www.reddit.com/r/startpages][/r/startpages]] and having an interest in playing around with some basic HTML+CSS+Js, I started working on this page. This page is a chance for me to write Javascript without using a framework like React.js or Angular.
** Design & Implementation
The webpage is being build in a way so that it is usable on both desktop and phones.
** Hosting
Since it is just a .html file the page is hosted on [[https://www.static-startup.surge.sh][static-startup.surge.sh]].
If you just want to inspect it locally you can just clone this repo by running:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone https://github.com/Flirre/startpage.git
#+END_SRC
Then you just open =index.html= in your preferred browser.

To set up your own [[https://www.surge.sh][surge.sh]] hosting you can install surge via npm
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
npm install --global surge
#+END_SRC

After installing surge you run the command
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
surge
#+END_SRC
